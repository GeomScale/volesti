A correlation class similar to spectrahedra:

A class to handle points associated to correlation matrices

To call to a sampling algorithm:

- Define convex body
- Call to get_samples_gaussian (only written for test files)

sampling.h:

uniform_sampling : calls to RandomPointGenerator


Gaussian, exponential 


A function to sample w.r.t. a distribution: uniform_sampling, gaussian_sampling, exponential sampling

UniformRandomPointGenerator, GaussianRandomPointGenerator, ...

Intersection methods: specialize for correlation matrices

- Avoid constructing matrices

- Higher degree eigenvalues problem: linearization -> matrix with structures
