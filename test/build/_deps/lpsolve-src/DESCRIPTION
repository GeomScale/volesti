Title: Interface to 'Lp_solve' v. 5.5 to Solve Linear/Integer Programs
Author: Michel Berkelaar and others
Maintainer: Gábor Csárdi <csardi.gabor@gmail.com>
Description: Lp_solve is freely available (under LGPL 2) software for
        solving linear, integer and mixed integer programs. In this
        implementation we supply a "wrapper" function in C and some R
        functions that solve general linear/integer problems,
        assignment problems, and transportation problems. This version
        calls lp_solve version 5.5.
