\title{Apply a random rotation to a convex polytope (H-polytope, V-polytope, zonotope or intersection of two V-polytopes)}
\usage{
rotate_polytope(P, T = NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{P}{A convex polytope. It is an object from class (a) Hpolytope, (b) Vpolytope, (c) Zonotope, (d) intersection of two V-polytopes.}

\item{T}{Optional. A \eqn{d\times d} rotation matrix.}
}
\value{
A list that contains the rotated polytope and the matrix \eqn{T} of the linear transformation.
}
\description{
Given a convex H- or V- polytope or a zonotope or an intersection of two V-polytopes as input, this function applies (a) a random rotation or (b) a given rotation by an input matrix \eqn{T}.
}
\details{
Let \eqn{P} be the given polytope and \eqn{Q} the rotated one and \eqn{T} be the matrix of the linear transformation. 
\itemize{
\item{If \eqn{P} is in H-representation and \eqn{A} is the matrix that contains the normal vectors of the facets of \eqn{Q} then \eqn{AT} contains the normal vactors of the facets of \eqn{P}.}
\item{If \eqn{P} is in V-representation and \eqn{V} is the matrix that contains column-wise the vertices of \eqn{Q} then \eqn{T^TV} contains the vertices of \eqn{P}.}
\item{If \eqn{P} is a zonotope and \eqn{G} is the matrix that contains column-wise the generators of \eqn{Q} then \eqn{T^TG} contains the generators of \eqn{P}.}
\item{If \eqn{M} is a matrix that contains column-wise points in \eqn{Q} then \eqn{T^TM} contains points in \eqn{P}.}

\examples{
# rotate a H-polytope (2d unit simplex)
P = gen_simplex(2,'H')
poly_matrix_list = rotate_polytope(P)

# rotate a V-polytope (3d cube)
P = gen_cube(3, 'V')
poly_matrix_list = rotate_polytope(P)

# rotate a 5-dimensional zonotope defined by the Minkowski sum of 15 segments
Z = gen_rand_zonotope(3,6)
poly_matrix_list = rotate_polytope(Z)
