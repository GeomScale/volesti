Description: Provides an R interface for 'volesti' C++ package. 'volesti' computes estimations of volume
             of polytopes given by (i) a set of points, (ii) linear inequalities or (iii) Minkowski sum of segments
             (a.k.a. zonotopes). There are three algorithms for volume estimation as well as algorithms
             for sampling, rounding and rotating polytopes. Moreover, 'volesti' provides algorithms for
             estimating copulas useful in computational finance.
