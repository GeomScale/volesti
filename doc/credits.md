### Contributors and package history

Main development started in 2012 by Vissarion Fisikopoulos while he was affiliated with National Kapodistrian University of Athens (NKUA, Greece), and then with University of Brussels (ULB, Belgium). The main sampling and volume algorithms were developed at that time. 

Later, Chalkis Apostolos affiliated with University of Athens (NKUA, Greece) and mentored by V.F. and partially supported by GSoC'2018, 2019 programs enhanced volesti with more algorithms for sampling and volume as well as an `R` interface.

We acknowledge several contributions by the open-source community most notably: 
* Pedro Zuidberg Dos Martires (KU Leuven): `python` interface
* Panagiotis Repouskos (NKUA, Greece): linear algebra operations with `eigen`
