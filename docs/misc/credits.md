Main development started in 2012 by Vissarion Fisikopoulos while he was affiliated with National Kapodistrian University of Athens (NKUA, Greece), and then with University of Brussels (ULB, Belgium). The main sampling and volume algorithms were developed at that time.

Later, Chalkis Apostolos affiliated with University of Athens (NKUA, Greece) and mentored by Vissarion Fisikopoulos \& Elias Tsigaridas and partially supported by GSoC'2018, 2019 programs enhanced volesti with more algorithms for sampling and volume as well as an `R` interface.

We acknowledge several contributions by the open-source community most notably:
* Pedro Zuidberg Dos Martires (KU Leuven): `python` interface
* Marios Papachristou (NTUA, Greece): ODE solvers, HMC sampler
* Panagiotis Repouskos (NKUA, Greece): linear algebra operations with `eigen`
* Haris Zafeiropoulos (UoC, Greece): `python` interface for metabolic networks
