### FALCONN - FAst Lookups of Cosine and Other Nearest Neighbors

FALCONN is a library with algorithms for the nearest neighbor search problem. The algorithms in FALCONN are based on
[Locality-Sensitive Hashing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Locality-sensitive_hashing) (LSH), which is a popular class of methods for nearest neighbor search in high-dimensional spaces.
The goal of FALCONN is to provide very efficient and well-tested implementations of LSH-based data structures.

Currently, FALCONN supports two LSH families for the [cosine similarity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cosine_similarity): hyperplane LSH and cross polytope LSH.
Both hash families are implemented with multi-probe LSH in order to minimize memory usage.
Moreover, FALCONN is optimized for both dense and sparse data.
Despite being designed for the cosine similarity, FALCONN can often be used for nearest neighbor search under
the Euclidean distance or a maximum inner product search.

FALCONN is written in C++ and consists of several modular core classes with a convenient wrapper around them.
Many mathematical operations in FALCONN are vectorized through the [Eigen](http://eigen.tuxfamily.org/index.php?title=Main_Page) and [FFHT](https://github.com/FALCONN-LIB/FFHT) libraries.
The core classes of FALCONN rely on [templates](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andrei_Alexandrescu) in order to avoid runtime overhead.

### How to use FALCONN

We provide a C++ interface for FALCONN as well as a [Python](https://www.python.org/) wrapper (that uses [NumPy](http://www.numpy.org/)). In the future, we plan to support more programming languages such as [Julia](http://julialang.org/). For C++, FALCONN is a header-only library and has no dependencies besides Eigen (which is also header-only),
so FALCONN is easy to set up. For further details, please see our [documentation](https://github.com/falconn-lib/falconn/wiki).

### How fast is FALCONN?

On data sets with about 1 million points in around 100 dimensions, FALCONN typically
requires a few milliseconds per query (running on a reasonably modern desktop CPU).

For more detailed results, see [ann-benchmarks](https://github.com/erikbern/ann-benchmarks) of [Erik Bernhardsson](https://erikbern.com/). Let us point out that FALCONN is especially competitive, when
the RAM budget is quite restrictive, which is not the regime the above benchmarks use.

### Authors

FALCONN is mainly developed by [Ilya Razenshteyn](http://www.ilyaraz.org/) and [Ludwig Schmidt](http://people.csail.mit.edu/ludwigs/).
FALCONN has grown out of a [research project](http://papers.nips.cc/paper/5893-practical-and-optimal-lsh-for-angular-distance) with our collaborators [Alexandr Andoni](http://www.mit.edu/~andoni/), [Piotr Indyk](https://people.csail.mit.edu/indyk/), and [Thijs Laarhoven](http://thijs.com/).

Many of the ideas used in FALCONN were proposed in research papers over the past 20 years (see the [documentation](https://github.com/FALCONN-LIB/FALCONN/wiki/Bibliography)).
